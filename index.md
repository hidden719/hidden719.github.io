Hi! I'm Adam(KyungPyo) Ham.

I recently completed my Master's degree at Ajou University and am now beginning my career as an AI research engineer. I have a passion for specialty coffee and handcrafted beer, and enjoy engaging in conversations with people. Let's connect and embark on a journey of knowledge, innovation, and delightful conversations!
